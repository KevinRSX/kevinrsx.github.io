title: New Blog and QEMU Snapshots
---

I recently created a new iteration of my blog using
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/),
and used this chance to learn about the basics of static site generators.

The first post is about the snapshotting functionality of `qemu-img`.
