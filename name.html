  <legend><strong>MY PREFERRED NAME</strong></legend>
  <p>
    <strong>TL;DR: Call me Kevin please!</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
Kaiwen Xue, my legal name, is produced by the Pinyin romanization of my Chinese
name. The Chinese characters of Kaiwen, however, are the same as the official
translation of people whose English names are Kevin (NBA player Kevin Durant's
Chinese translation can be romanized as Kaiwen Dulante, for example). Kaiwen and
Kevin are therefore essentially the same thing, but the latter makes much more
sense in the English world. Therefore, I wish to be referred to as Kevin as
often as possible, while one is always free to address me by anything.

  <p>
Indeed, when my mom conceived, she and my dad decided that my English name
would be <span style="font-family: monospace;">
(is_boy ? "Kevin" : "Kerry")</span>. Not the coolest names those are, I believe 
asking English-speaking people to call me Kevin is one way, though insufficient,
to thank them for supporting my education abroad over the years.
